## LMNT Electrolyte Mix – A Fasting Favorite

Hydration is one of the most overlooked aspects of fasting and low-carb living. LMNT is a high-sodium electrolyte mix that’s become a staple for biohackers, athletes, and anyone on intermittent fasting or keto protocols.

### What Makes LMNT Stand Out?
- **High Sodium** – 1000 mg per packet
- **Zero Sugar** – Unlike Liquid I.V. or Gatorade
- **Balanced Formula** – With potassium and magnesium
- **Great Flavors** – Citrus Salt, Raspberry, and Chocolate Salt are fan favorites

### Why Use It While Fasting?
When you fast, insulin drops—and along with it, your kidneys flush out sodium. This can lead to fatigue, dizziness, and "keto flu" symptoms. LMNT helps replenish lost minerals without breaking your fast.

### How to Use
- Add one stick to 16–32 oz of water
- Use during fasting windows, workouts, or sauna sessions
- Best taken in the morning or mid-fast when energy dips

### How It Compares
| Brand | Sodium (mg) | Sugar | Flavors | Notes |
|-------|--------------|--------|---------|-------|
| **LMNT** | 1000 | 0g | 8+ | Ideal for fasting, clean ingredients |
| Liquid I.V. | 500 | 11g | 10+ | Great for rehydration, but has sugar |
| Ultima | 55 | 0g | 10+ | Good for casual use, low sodium |
| Keto Chow Drops | 0 | 0g | None | Pure minerals, no taste or sweeteners |

### Final Verdict
LMNT is purpose-built for those who sweat, fast, or follow a low-carb lifestyle. With its no-BS formulation and smart sodium dosing, it’s a top-tier tool for hydration and performance.
