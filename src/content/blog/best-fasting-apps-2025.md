## Zero â€“ Best Overall
[Zero](/blog/zero-fasting-app-review) strikes the perfect balance between simplicity and education. The fasting timer is sleek, the content is research-driven, and the app evolves with you.

- **Pros:** Easy to use, motivating streaks, science-backed
- **Cons:** No food tracking or wearables integration

## DoFasting â€“ Best for Structured Plans
DoFasting offers more hand-holding than most. Youâ€™ll get meal plans, push notifications, and even workout guidanceâ€”but itâ€™s behind a paywall.

- **Pros:** Great for beginners who want structure
- **Cons:** Pricey, some ads, pushy upsells

## Fastient â€“ Best for Journaling
If you want to reflect on your fasting experience, Fastient is your minimal journal-first tracker. Itâ€™s not fancy, but itâ€™s clean and effective.

- **Pros:** Privacy-focused, supports notes and moods
- **Cons:** Lacks guidance or community features

## Window â€“ Best for Apple Users
Window has one of the best-designed interfaces and integrates smoothly with Apple Health. Itâ€™s visually rewarding and well-suited for people tracking with an Apple Watch.

- **Pros:** Beautiful design, native iOS features
- **Cons:** Not as robust on Android
