## Zero – Best Overall
[Zero](../zero-fasting-app-review) strikes the perfect balance between simplicity and education. The fasting timer is sleek, the content is research-driven, and the app evolves with you.

- **Pros:** Easy to use, motivating streaks, science-backed  
- **Cons:** No food tracking or wearables integration

## DoFasting – Best for Structured Plans
DoFasting offers more hand-holding than most. You’ll get meal plans, push notifications, and even workout guidance—but it’s behind a paywall.

- **Cons:** Pricey, some ads, pushy upsells

## Fastient – Best for Journaling
If you want to reflect on your fasting experience, Fastient is your minimal journal-first tracker. It’s not fancy, but it’s clean and effective.

- **Pros:** Privacy-focused, supports notes and moods  
- **Cons:** Lacks guidance or community features

## Window – Best for Apple Users
Window has one of the best-designed interfaces and integrates smoothly with Apple Health. It’s visually rewarding and well-suited for people tracking with an Apple Watch.

- **Pros:** Beautiful design, native iOS features  
- **Cons:** Not as robust on Android
