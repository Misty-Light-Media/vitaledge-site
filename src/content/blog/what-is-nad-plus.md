If you've spent any time in the world of health optimization, you've probably seen the term **NAD+** tossed around. But what is it, and why are scientists, biohackers, and doctors all talking about it?

## The Role of NAD+

NAD+ (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) is a coenzyme found in all living cells. It's essential for converting food into energy, repairing DNA, and regulating cellular stress. In short—it helps your cells function at their best.

Unfortunately, **your NAD+ levels decline with age**, and this drop is linked to fatigue, slower metabolism, cognitive decline, and even chronic diseases.

## How NAD+ Declines With Age

After age 30, NAD+ levels can drop by up to 50%. Factors like poor sleep, stress, alcohol, and lack of exercise can speed up the loss. Lower NAD+ means your cells can't generate energy as efficiently or repair themselves as well.

## Can You Boost NAD+ Naturally?

Yes—but it’s slow. Fasting, high-intensity interval training (HIIT), and quality sleep help support NAD+ production. But to see significant boosts, most people turn to **supplements**.

## The Smart Way: NAD+ Supplements

These supplements provide your body with NAD+ precursors—building blocks it can use to restore levels. Here are the most popular, science-backed options:

### 🔬 Tru Niagen® (Nicotinamide Riboside)
Supports energy metabolism and healthy aging. Clinically studied.

### 🧬 Toniiq NMN
High-purity NMN, third-party tested. Fast-acting and clean formula.

### 🫐 Elysium Basis
Combines NR with pterostilbene (from blueberries) for antioxidant synergy.

## Final Thoughts

If you're serious about feeling sharper, sleeping better, and aging smarter, NAD+ is worth your attention.
