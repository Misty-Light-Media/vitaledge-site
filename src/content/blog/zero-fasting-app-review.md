Fasting without structure is hard. That’s where Zero comes in. It's one of the most popular apps for tracking intermittent fasting windows, offering timers, insights, and science-backed articles to keep you on track.

## What Is the Zero App?
Zero is a mobile app designed to help you time and track your fasting windows. It supports common methods like 16:8, 18:6, OMAD, and even custom schedules. The clean interface makes it easy to see your progress and stay committed.

## Key Features
- **Fasting timer** with real-time countdown and streak tracking
- **Daily content** from doctors and researchers
- **Personalized plans** based on your goals (weight loss, energy, longevity)
- **Mood, weight, and journal logs**
- **Zero Plus** (paid tier) unlocks advanced analytics and coaching insights

## What We Loved
- **Simple UI:** It’s one of the easiest fasting apps to navigate
- **Educational tools:** Daily articles help users learn and stay engaged
- **Community vibe:** Built-in streaks and visuals feel rewarding and gamified

## Any Drawbacks?
- **Limited food logging** — It’s not a MyFitnessPal replacement
- **Coaching locked behind a paywall**
- **No direct biometric integration (yet)**

## Final Verdict
If you’re new to fasting or want an easy way to stay accountable, Zero is a fantastic starting point. It’s not overloaded with features, and what it does, it does very well.
