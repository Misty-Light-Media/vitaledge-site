Red Light Therapy (RLT) has exploded in popularity among biohackers and wellness enthusiasts — with promises of better skin, reduced inflammation, and faster recovery. But do the panels work? And how do you choose the right one?

## What is Red Light Therapy?

RLT uses low-wavelength red and near-infrared light to penetrate the skin and stimulate cellular energy (ATP) production. It’s been studied for:

- **Skin health** (acne, wrinkles, texture)  
- **Pain & inflammation** relief  
- **Workout recovery**  
- **Sleep and mood**  

It’s painless, non-invasive, and can be done at home — with the right panel.

## How to Choose a Quality RLT Panel

Not all red light panels are equal. The best combine:

- **Wavelengths:** 660nm (red) + 850nm (near-infrared)  
- **Power Density:** Measured in mW/cm²; 100+ is ideal  
- **Treatment Area:** Bigger panels = more efficient sessions  
- **EMF Emission:** Low or zero EMF for safety  
- **Build Quality:** Durable LEDs, good cooling, third-party testing

## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

**What does red light therapy actually do?**  
RLT stimulates mitochondria to produce more ATP, improving energy, recovery, and skin health.

**How often should you use red light therapy panels?**  
Most studies suggest 10–20 minutes per session, 3–7 times per week, depending on the goal.

**Does red light therapy really work for skin?**  
Yes — clinical trials show improvements in collagen production, wrinkle reduction, and skin texture after consistent use.

**Can red light therapy help with pain and recovery?**  
Yes. Near-infrared wavelengths penetrate deeper tissues, reducing inflammation and supporting muscle recovery.
