Red Light Therapy (RLT) has exploded in popularity among biohackers and wellness enthusiasts — with promises of better skin, reduced inflammation, and faster recovery. But do the panels work? And how do you choose the right one?

## What is Red Light Therapy?

RLT uses low-wavelength red and near-infrared light to penetrate the skin and stimulate cellular energy (ATP) production. It’s been studied for:

- **Skin health** (acne, wrinkles, texture)
- **Pain & inflammation** relief
- **Workout recovery**
- **Sleep and mood**

It’s painless, non-invasive, and can be done at home — with the right panel.

## How to Choose a Quality RLT Panel

Not all red light panels are equal. The best combine:

- **Wavelengths:** 660nm (red) + 850nm (near-infrared)
- **Power Density:** Measured in mW/cm²; 100+ is ideal
- **Treatment Area:** Bigger panels = more efficient sessions
- **EMF Emission:** Low or zero EMF for safety
- **Build Quality:** Durable LEDs, good cooling, third-party testing
