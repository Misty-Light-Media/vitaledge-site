When it comes to optimizing your metabolism and understanding how your body responds to food, fasting, and exercise‚Äîtechnology is catching up in a big way. In this guide, we compare **Lumen**, **Biosense**, and **Levels**, three leading metabolic trackers designed for slightly different (but overlapping) goals.

## What They Measure

| Device     | Measurement | Best For                      |
|------------|-------------|-------------------------------|
| **Lumen**  | CO‚ÇÇ in breath (fat vs carb burn) | Daily nutrition & fasting decisions |
| **Biosense** | Acetone in breath (ketone levels) | Keto tracking & fat-burning depth |
| **Levels** | Glucose via CGM | Blood sugar responses to meals & habits |

## 1. Lumen ‚Äì For Real-Time Fat/Carb Feedback
[Lumen](../lumen-review) helps you see if you're burning fat or carbs each morning by analyzing CO‚ÇÇ in your breath. It‚Äôs designed to guide nutrition, workouts, and fasting with a simple 1-to-5 score.

- **Great for:** Intermittent fasting, metabolic flexibility, daily feedback  
- **Downsides:** Doesn‚Äôt measure glucose or ketones directly  

**What it‚Äôs like to use:** Each morning, you breathe into the device while fasting. Within seconds, Lumen provides a score that reflects your metabolic state. The app then gives daily guidance on how to adjust your carb intake, workout intensity, or fasting strategy based on your result. It‚Äôs especially helpful for those seeking real-time course correction.

## 2. Biosense ‚Äì For Deep Ketosis Insight
Biosense is a medical-grade breath ketone meter that measures **acetone**, a byproduct of fat metabolism. It‚Äôs more accurate than urine strips and less invasive than blood tests.

- **Great for:** Keto, low-carb, fasted state analysis  
- **Downsides:** Doesn‚Äôt guide daily meals or activity as clearly  

**Real-world performance:** Biosense provides a ‚Äúketone score‚Äù (ACE) that reflects how deep into ketosis you are. Many users test 2‚Äì3 times daily‚Äîbefore and after meals or fasts‚Äîto monitor how food or fasting shifts their fat-burning state. It's especially useful for extended fasts and fine-tuning a ketogenic lifestyle.

## 3. Levels ‚Äì For Glucose Optimization
Levels uses a **continuous glucose monitor (CGM)** to show how your blood sugar responds to food, sleep, and stress. It gives insights into your insulin sensitivity and metabolic resilience over time.

- **Great for:** Data-driven eaters, metabolic health, longevity tracking  
- **Downsides:** Requires wearable sensor; more expensive  

**User experience:** You wear a CGM patch (usually FreeStyle Libre) for 14 days. The Levels app syncs data and delivers a metabolic scorecard‚Äîrating each meal or activity based on its blood sugar response. The onboarding includes personalized insights and trends over time, making it ideal for habit experimentation.

| Feature               | **Lumen**      | **Biosense**    | **Levels**        |
|-----------------------|----------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Metric Type           | CO‚ÇÇ            | Acetone (ketones)| Glucose (blood)   |
| Device Type           | Breath sensor  | Breath sensor    | Wearable CGM      |
| Ideal Diet Fit        | Fasting, low-carb | Keto             | All diets         |
| Insight Frequency     | Daily spot check | Daily spot check | Continuous        |
| Coaching/Nutrition    | Yes            | No               | Yes (with app)    |
| Price Range (USD)     | ~$249 + subscription | ~$299 no sub | ~$199/mo or $399+ up front |
| Subscription Model    | Required       | Optional         | Required          |

## ‚ùì Frequently Asked Questions

**Which metabolic tracker is best for fasting?**  
Lumen is best for fasters, as it shows real-time fat vs carb burn and helps optimize fasting windows.

**Is Biosense more accurate than Lumen?**  
Biosense directly measures ketones (acetone), making it more precise for ketogenic diets. Lumen measures CO‚ÇÇ to infer fuel use, so they complement each other.

**Does Levels require a prescription?**  
Yes, Levels uses a CGM sensor (like FreeStyle Libre), which requires a prescription in some regions. Levels facilitates access for subscribers.

**Can I use more than one tracker at a time?**  
Yes. Many biohackers pair Lumen with Levels for short- vs long-term feedback, or Biosense with Levels to track both ketones and glucose.

## Final Verdict
Each device offers a unique lens into your metabolic function:

- Choose **Lumen** if you want to optimize fasting and fuel usage day to day.  
- Go with **Biosense** if you need deeper ketosis validation for keto or fasted states.  
- Pick **Levels** if blood sugar response and insulin control are your primary focus.  

**Pro tip:** Many biohackers use a combo approach:  
- **Lumen + Levels** gives short-term feedback + long-term glucose tracking.  
- **Biosense + Levels** shows both ketone and glucose trends‚Äîideal for low-carb endurance athletes.
